# GNOME Shell Extensions – Recommended for Zaatar

Zaatar pre-installs **Dash to Dock** and **Blur my Shell**. Install the rest from [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/) for the full Tahoe-like experience.

## Pre-installed and enabled by default

|-----------|-------------|
| [Dash to Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/) | Dock at bottom for launching apps – **enabled on first boot** |
| [Blur my Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/) | Blur on panel, dash, overview – **enabled on first boot** |

## Recommended (install manually)

Open **Extensions** app (or visit extensions.gnome.org) and install:

## Quick install (browser)

1. Install [GNOME Shell integration](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation) for Chrome/Firefox.
2. Visit each link above and click **ON** to install.

## Open Bar + wallpaper

[Open Bar](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6580/open-bar/) can **auto-theme** from your desktop background – it extracts colors and applies them to the Top Bar, menus, and dash. Works great with the Zaatar fluidic wallpapers.
